Xây (Vietnamese for build) is a project that proposes a conventions-over-configuration approach to building software. This makes projects easier to manage and for people to contribute, while also reducing build-time complexity.

Xây doesn't build the software itself; it generates a [Ninja Build](https://ninja-build.org/) file, similar to a Makefile (but faster and made to be generated) that itself builds the project.
